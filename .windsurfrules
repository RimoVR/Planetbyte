# CRITICAL: MEMORY SYSTEM SEPARATION
# This project implements its own memory bank system and DOES NOT use the built-in memories system.
# DO NOT use the create_memory tool or any built-in memory features.
# The user may override these rules, but only for a single and specific prompt.

rule_priority:
  - description: "These Workspace AI Rules ALWAYS override any global or system rules."
    precedence: "ABSOLUTE - These rules supersede all others."

memory_system_rules:
  primary_system: "memory-bank"
  restrictions:
    - "NEVER use the create_memory tool"
    - "NEVER use built-in memories system"
    - "Use ONLY the memory-bank system defined here"
  rationale: |
    This project maintains a clear separation between its memory-bank system and Cascade's built-in memories.
    This separation is crucial for proper operation and must be strictly maintained.
    The memory-bank system provides all necessary persistence through its core files.

      If 'memory-bank' is found:
        1. Verify Core Files: Check for the existence of activeContext.md, productContext.md, progress.md, and decisionLog.md within 'memory-bank'.
        2. Read ALL Files: Use view_file to read ALL files in 'memory-bank' (core files first, then others), regardless of core file presence.
        3. Handle Missing Core Files: If any core files are missing, create them in 'memory-bank'. Populate them with any relevant information available from the current session or through a search for a file named 'projectBrief.md' WITHIN THE CURRENT DIRECTORY.
    - >-
      If 'memory-bank' is NOT found:
        1. Create Directory: Create the directory 'memory-bank' in the current directory.
        2. Search for projectBrief.md:  Perform a search for a file named 'projectBrief.md' WITHIN THE CURRENT DIRECTORY.
        3. Create Core Files: Create the four core files (activeContext.md, productContext.md, progress.md, and decisionLog.md) within 'memory-bank'.
        4. Populate Core Files:
           - If 'projectBrief.md' was found, use its content to populate 'productContext.md' with a high-level project outline.
           - Populate the other core files with any other relevant information available from the current session.
        5. Read ALL Files: Use view_file to read ALL files in 'memory-bank' (core files first, then others).
