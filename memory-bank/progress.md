# Project Progress - PlanetByte

## Completed Tasks

### Performance Optimization
1. **Delta Compression Implementation**
   - Implemented delta compression for network updates
   - Added type-specific optimizations for game data
   - Integrated compression statistics tracking

2. **Metrics Collection System**
   - Created MetricsCollector class with multiple metric types
   - Implemented InterestMetrics for specialized tracking
   - Integrated metrics collection into key systems

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Created performance test script (test-performance.js)
   - Verified bandwidth reduction from delta compression
   - Confirmed processing time improvements

## In Progress

### Network Optimization
1. **Adaptive Grid Cell Sizing**
