## Upcoming Tasks

### High Priority (Implement Now)
1. **Infrastructure Setup**
   - [ ] Provision Hetzner server
   - [ ] Install Docker and Coolify
   - [ ] Configure networking and security
   - [ ] Set up Nginx reverse proxy

2. **Containerization**
   - [ ] Create Dockerfiles for each component
   - [ ] Set up Docker Compose for local testing
   - [ ] Configure container networking
   - [ ] Implement CI/CD pipeline

3. **Self-hosted Supabase**
   - [ ] Deploy Supabase using Docker
   - [ ] Migrate database schema and data
   - [ ] Configure authentication providers
   - [ ] Test API compatibility

4. **Developer Art Implementation**
   - [ ] Create shape generators for entities
   - [ ] Implement color system for factions and items
   - [ ] Develop grid-based tile rendering
   - [ ] Build asset manager with swappable interface

5. **Core MVP Features**
   - [ ] Basic client with Phaser 3 canvas
   - [ ] Core player movement
   - [ ] Basic Colyseus.js server setup
   - [ ] Client-server communication
   - [ ] Basic shooting mechanics
   - [ ] Server-side hit detection
   - [ ] Simple spatial partitioning
   - [ ] Faction-based play and base capturing
   - [ ] Basic respawn mechanics

### Medium Priority (If Easy/Necessary)
- [ ] Simple item drop system
- [ ] Basic ability system (one of each type)
- [ ] Simple fog of war implementation
- [ ] Day/night cycle if core to gameplay
- [ ] Basic UI elements
- [ ] Authentication system

### Lower Priority (Defer)
- [ ] Advanced optimizations like adaptive grid sizing
- [ ] Complex interest management
- [ ] Advanced physics and environmental effects
- [ ] Performance metrics and analytics
- [ ] Polished UI elements
- [ ] Advanced ability variations
- [ ] AI-generated artwork integration

## Known Issues
- None currently identified for the new design approach
