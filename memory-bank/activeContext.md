## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Considerations
1. **Performance Optimization**: Need to establish benchmarks and optimization strategies early to ensure the game can handle the target of 10,000 concurrent players.

2. **Network Architecture**: Evaluating the best approach for spatial partitioning and interest management to minimize bandwidth usage while maintaining responsive gameplay.

3. **Asset Pipeline**: Determining the most efficient workflow for creating, optimizing, and delivering game assets, particularly for mobile devices.

4. **Testing Strategy**: Defining the testing approach for both client and server components, including unit tests, integration tests, and playtesting methodology.

5. **Shared Deterministic Modules**: Implementing core logic for movement, collision, physics, and ability resolution as shared TypeScript modules between client and server to ensure deterministic simulation.

6. **Database Schema Design**: Designing an extensible database schema for player statistics, item attributes, and game state persistence.

### Design Considerations
1. **Ability Balance**: Establishing a framework for balancing the various player abilities to ensure fair and engaging gameplay.

2. **Map Design**: Determining the optimal map size and layout for different player counts, including rules for dynamic resizing.

3. **Progression System**: Refining the experience and Elo-like system to provide meaningful progression without creating insurmountable advantages.

4. **Faction Mechanics**: Developing detailed mechanics for faction-based territorial control and ensuring balanced competition.

5. **Item Rarity System**: Implementing a four-tier rarity system (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic) with appropriate stat bonuses.

6. **Armor Types**: Designing four distinct armor types (Plasma Shield, Energy Shield, Plate, Berserk) with unique regeneration mechanics.

7. **Trinket System**: Creating a system of unique modifiers that alter playstyle through inherent advantages and disadvantages.

8. **Map Generation**: Implementing a hybrid map approach with a fixed central region and three peripheral biomes.

### Open Questions
1. How will we handle peak load scenarios when player count approaches or exceeds the 10,000 target?

2. What metrics should we track during early playtesting to inform game balance decisions?

3. How can we optimize the onboarding experience to get new players into the action quickly while still teaching core mechanics?

4. What is the most efficient approach to implement the fog of war system that balances visual quality with performance?

5. How should we structure the ability augmentation system to allow for meaningful customization while maintaining balance?

6. What is the most efficient approach to implement the hybrid map system with central region and peripheral biomes?

7. How should we design the database schema to efficiently store and query player statistics and item attributes?

8. What is the best way to implement the trinket system to ensure interesting gameplay without creating balance issues?

9. How can we optimize the rendering of fog of war with the extended cone in the facing direction?

10. How can we best handle the monorepo setup with pnpm workspaces and ensure proper dependency management between packages?
