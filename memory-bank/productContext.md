# PlanetByte Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

PlanetByte aims to resurrect the arcade spirit of mid-2000s multiplayer Flash games while leveraging modern web technologies for rapid, scalable development. The project exists to create an accessible, engaging multiplayer experience that combines the best elements of classic arcade shooters with modern MMO persistence and strategic depth.

The game fills a gap in the current market for browser-based multiplayer games that are:
- Immediately accessible without downloads or installations
- Playable across multiple platforms (PC, Mac, Android, iOS)
- Strategically deep but mechanically straightforward
- Visually distinctive with a pixelated art style
- Technically optimized for modern web standards

## Problems It Solves

1. **Accessibility Barriers**: Many modern multiplayer games require significant downloads, installations, and hardware requirements. PlanetByte is playable directly in browsers across multiple devices.

2. **Complexity Overload**: Many MMOs have steep learning curves with complex systems. PlanetByte offers immediate action with a gradual depth curve.

3. **Technical Limitations**: Traditional browser games struggled with performance and scale. PlanetByte leverages modern web technologies to overcome these limitations.

4. **Player Engagement**: The faction-based territorial control system creates persistent meaning to combat beyond individual matches.

5. **Development Efficiency**: The technical architecture is designed for rapid iteration and scaling, using managed services to minimize DevOps overhead.

## How It Should Work

### Core Gameplay Loop

1. **Join a Faction**: Players select one of three competing factions upon first login.

2. **Deploy to Battlefield**: Players spawn at faction-controlled bases or respawn points.

3. **Engage in Combat**: Players fight enemies using weapons and abilities, with the fog of war system creating tactical depth.

4. **Capture Territory**: Teams work together to capture and hold strategic points on the map.

5. **Collect & Upgrade**: Defeated enemies may drop items that can be used to customize loadouts.

6. **Progress Character**: Experience earned through combat and objectives allows for persistent character development.

### Key Differentiators

1. **Dynamic Map System**: The battlefield expands and contracts based on player population, ensuring optimal combat density.

2. **Fog of War**: Limited visibility creates opportunities for strategic play, ambushes, and reconnaissance.

3. **Ability Customization**: The four-slot ability system (Movement, Offense, Defense, Support) with augmentations allows for diverse playstyles.

4. **Environmental Factors**: Day/night cycles and dynamic hazards create evolving battlefield conditions.

5. **Balanced Progression**: The Elo-like system prevents runaway advantages while still rewarding skilled play.

## User Experience Goals

### Accessibility
- **Immediate Engagement**: Players should be in combat within 60 seconds of first visit.
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Controls adapt seamlessly between touch, mouse/keyboard, and gamepad.
- **Performance Optimization**: Minimum 60 FPS on modern mobile devices with integrated graphics.

### Satisfaction
- **"Snappy" Movement**: Controls should feel responsive and precise.
- **Impactful Combat**: Weapons and abilities should provide satisfying feedback.
- **Strategic Depth**: Players should discover new tactics and combinations over time.
- **Meaningful Progression**: Character development should feel rewarding without creating insurmountable advantages.

### Social Dynamics
- **Faction Identity**: Players should develop loyalty to their chosen faction.
- **Team Coordination**: Design encourages spontaneous cooperation between strangers.
- **Discord Integration**: Seamless authentication and communication through Discord.

### Technical Experience
- **Latency Tolerance**: Maximum 50ms latency for responsive gameplay.
