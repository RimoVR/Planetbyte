# PlanetByte Decision Log

This document records key decisions made during the development of PlanetByte, including technical, architectural, and implementation decisions, along with the rationale and alternatives considered.

## Architectural Decisions

### AD-001: Client-Server Architecture with Clear Separation of Concerns

**Date**: March 10, 2025

**Decision**: Implement a client-server architecture with clear separation between frontend (client) and backend (server) components.

**Context**: The game requires a multiplayer architecture that can support thousands of concurrent players while preventing cheating and ensuring fair gameplay.

**Rationale**:
- Server-authoritative model prevents client-side cheating
- Clear separation of concerns improves maintainability
- Allows independent scaling of client and server components
- Enables different optimization strategies for each component

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Peer-to-peer architecture**: Rejected due to security concerns, difficulty in preventing cheating, and challenges in scaling to thousands of players.
2. **Hybrid model with client authority for some actions**: Rejected to maintain a consistent security model, though client-side prediction will be used for responsiveness.

**Consequences**:
- Increased development complexity
- Additional latency compared to client-only calculations
- Need for client-side prediction and server reconciliation
- Better security and cheat prevention

### AD-002: Managed Services Approach for Infrastructure

- More complex grid management system
- Need for careful tuning of density thresholds
- Better network and server performance
- More efficient entity updates
- Foundation for future spatial partitioning optimizations

## Future Decisions Pending

### FD-001: Asset Pipeline and Art Style Implementation

**Status**: Under consideration

**Context**: The game requires a consistent art style and efficient asset delivery.

**Options Being Considered**:
1. Custom asset pipeline with automated optimization
2. Third-party asset management solutions
3. Procedural generation for certain elements

**Decision Criteria**:
- Performance impact on various devices
- Development time and complexity
- Flexibility for future art style evolution
- Support for AI-generated artwork integration

### FD-002: Matchmaking and Player Distribution

**Status**: Under consideration

**Context**: The game needs to efficiently distribute players across servers and regions.

**Options Being Considered**:
1. Geographic-based distribution with region selection
2. Skill-based matchmaking within regions
3. Dynamic server allocation based on population

**Decision Criteria**:
- Latency impact on gameplay
- Balance between factions
- Server resource utilization
- Player experience and preferences

### FD-003: Module System Standardization

**Status**: Under consideration

**Context**: The project currently has a mix of ESM and CommonJS modules, causing potential compatibility issues.

**Options Being Considered**:
1. Standardize on CommonJS for all packages
2. Standardize on ESM for all packages
3. Maintain hybrid approach with clear boundaries
4. Use bundlers to abstract module system differences

**Decision Criteria**:
- Compatibility with existing libraries and frameworks
- Development experience and tooling support
- Build performance and complexity
- Future compatibility with evolving JavaScript ecosystem

### FD-004: Performance Metrics Collection

**Status**: Under consideration

**Context**: The interest management system needs performance monitoring to ensure it scales effectively.

**Options Being Considered**:
1. Custom metrics collection integrated with the interest management system
2. Third-party monitoring solutions
3. Distributed tracing for end-to-end performance analysis

**Decision Criteria**:
- Overhead of metrics collection
- Granularity of performance data
- Ease of integration with existing systems
- Visualization and analysis capabilities
